# How to Verify Your Addon

To verify your addon you must join the [discord](https://discord.gg/XU7Y9G46KD) server and create a post in the [#verification-request](https://discord.gg/K7JUgp9dSc) channel.

Your post must include:

- A Github repository link
- A short description of what your addon does

_Verification may take time. You will be notified when a decision has been made._

## What Will Prevent Verification

Your addon will not be verified if it includes or violates any of the following:

- Harmful or malicious features (e.g., backdoors, coordinate leaks, remote control)
- Obfuscated, unreadable, or intentionally confusing code
- Forks of addons that are still actively maintained (commits within the past 6 months)
- Addons that copy modules from other addons without proper credit and meaningful changes

# Verified Addon Requirements

Once verified, your addon must continue to meet the following requirements to remain verified:

- Code must remain open-source and free of obfuscated, unreadable, or intentionally confusing code
- No hidden, deceptive, or user-targeting code. This includes code that:
  - Disconnects, kicks, or otherwise disrupts the users
  - Gives a user remote control over another user's client or actions
  - Collects or sends private data (e.g, coordinates, IPs, messages) without clear consent
  - _Cosmetic features (e.g., user-specific capes or badges) are allowed, as long as they are purely visual and do not affect gameplay or performance_
- Addons should not cause severe performance issues or crashes
- Addons should be maintained to remain compatible with current Meteor Client and Minecraft versions
  - _Addons abandoned for extended periods may lose verified status_

# Policy Violations & Consequences

## First Offense

The addon will be unverified until changes are made to comply with policies. If there is a clear way to contact the developer (discord username), the developer will be informed of the issues and given a chance to fix them.

## Second Offense

The addon will be permanently unverified and will not be eligible for re-verification in the future.

## Appeals and Re-Verification

Developers may appeal a verification decision by contacting **cqb13** on discord.
